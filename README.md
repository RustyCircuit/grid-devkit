# Grid Devkit

KiCad PCB designed to interoperate with the [Intech Studio](https://github.com/intechstudio) Grid ecosystem. This devkit is a fork of [Intech's VSNX hardware design](https://github.com/intechstudio/grid-hardware/tree/master/Electrical/Design/PCBA-VSNX), adapted to fill a gap between fully-developed hardware and breadboard/DIY controller designs.

### KiCad Libraries

Custom libraries needed to be loaded into KiCad are found in [Intech's `grid-hardware` repo](https://github.com/intechstudio/grid-hardware).

### Firmware

The intended firmware for this devkit is found in [Intech's `grid-fw` repo](https://github.com/intechstudio/grid-fw).
